# Sourcemap-Extractor

A simple tool for extracting source code files from a JavaScript source map file and organizing them in the directory structure.

It uses modules "source-map" https://www.npmjs.com/package/source-map to parse source map files and "mkdirp" https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp to create the necessary directory structures.


## Getting started

Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.

Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command in the project directory:
```bash
npm install
```
Place your main.js and its corresponding source map file in the project directory.

Run the extraction script by using the following command:
```bash
npm start
```
